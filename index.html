    <p>

        Most of these tv shows and movies are science fiction, but there are a few that aren't. These tv shows and
        movies are one of the best I've watched, and wanted others to know about them especially since since many of
        them are underrated. Although I'm one to avoid tv shows that have been cancelled, I did include some tv shows
        that have been cancelled. I included these tv shows because they are worth watching, and they left me
        wondering of what could've happened.

        <br><br>


        If you've watched a movie or a tv show with a similar concept to any of these, comment them below.
