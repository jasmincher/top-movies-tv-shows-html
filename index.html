    <h1>Why <i>Must Watch</i> TV Shows and Movies?</h1>

    <p>
      I'm very picky when it comes to movies and tv shows. After hours, days, and even weeks of looking at movie and tv
      show trailers, I got bored of seeing the typical plot, which I know will lead to the typical ending. I like
      watching tv shows and movies that make me feel more than just sad, happy, or scared. I like to watch things that
      make me think and question. I also got bored of browsing websites that only displayed the movie poster with a long
      summary, and no trailer. That's why I created this website. Simple. To the point. And movies and tv shows you
      might have never heard of. Most of the tv shows and movies included in these lists are science fiction, so if you
      like this genre, you defintely have to checkout some of these titles. However, I do have in these lists other
      genres as well. These titles are definetely worth watching, as many of them are underrated, and are overshadowed
      by mainstream titles. Although I'm one to avoid tv shows that have been cancelled, I did include some tv shows
      that have been cancelled. I included these tv shows because they are worth watching, and they left me wondering of
      what could have happened.
