    <h1>Why did you create this website?</h1>

    <p>
      <!-- 
      show "news" on the tv shows or also possibly add this into tv shows itself -->
      <!-- 
      upcoming tv shows and movies and here include what tv shows and movies are you exzcited about-->

      I'm very picky when it comes to movies and tv shows. After hours, days, and even weeks of looking at movie and tv
      show trailers, I got bored of seeing the typical plot, which I know will lead to the typical ending.

      Most of these tv shows and movies are science fiction, but there are a few that aren't. These tv shows and
      movies are one of the best I've watched, and wanted others to know about them especially since since many of
      them are underrated. Although I'm one to avoid tv shows that have been cancelled, I did include some tv shows
      that have been cancelled. I included these tv shows because they are worth watching, and they left me
      wondering of what could've happened. I like movies that do more than just make me feel sad, happy, or scared, I
      like movies that make me think, make me wonder, and make me question.

      <br><br>


      If you've watched a movie or a tv show with a similar concept to any of these, comment them below.
